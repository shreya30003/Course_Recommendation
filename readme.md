# Course Recommendation System

This is a course recommendation system based on TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity. The system is deployed using Flask.

## Demo Videos and Images

You can find demo videos and images in the "Samples" folder. These resources provide a visual demonstration of how the course recommendation system works.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Flask application by executing `python app.py`.
4. Access the system through your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

Once the system is up and running, you can use it to get course recommendations. Simply enter your preferences and the system will provide a list of recommended courses based on your input.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any ideas for improvement or would like to report a bug, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Scope for Improvement

One possible enhancement is to recommend the top 5 colleges for each course. This can be achieved by incorporating additional data and refining the recommendation algorithm.
